FEATURES TODO
suggestions/fixes

=== General

[1] more config options in lua modules ('setup' functions with more options,
    and sometimes any options :P).
    Other options: amount of tab spaces, disable relative line numbers,
        
[2] export more common config options to the 'starconfig' instead of 
    'init.lua', most options should be accesible by keystreaks.

[3] auto-save after typing, like in intelliJ editors.

=== starvcs

[1] add 'git log' coloring via builtin highlighting (later, after the module
    gets basic functionality)

[2] make the module stable - right now it is quite unstable and in a more of
    a debug state than anything

=== starkeys

[1] right now when the keystreak is incomplete, a window will appear, but the
    buffer is cleared and you have to retype the keystreak, add a loop keeping
    current selection and 'ESC' key clear keystreak to clear the current input.

=== starplugin

[1] it seems the automatic update is broken for some reason, does not run
    on startup unless your local repos are clear/reverted. [DONE]

=== starfinder

[1] a project finder tool, remembers last projects and any opened file
    outside of them. [MAJOR REDESIGN]

=== starproject

[1] create a project which remembers opened workspace (just opened files for 
    now), define commandline project tasks (build, clean, etc)

[2] screen to select last used projects

[3] ability to open project diectory as a project (if you cannot find it in 
    recents)

=== starpopup

[1] add clickable buttons


TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
upgrades to existing structure

=== starevent [WIP - phase 1]

a unified bus to capture events coming from different modules.
core concept is simple, however it would require a rewrite of every other
module, it would be crucial then to make the interface complete and succint.

[phase 1] implement module
[phase 2] rewrite other modules

=== starlog [PLAN]

with an event bus this will simply capture all messages and write them to the
log file.

=== common UI API [PLAN]

right now there are 2 modules which deal with UI: starwindow and starpopup.
both of those had been created to initially serve one purpose:
to show keystreak preview and plugin update notification respectively.
since they had different functionality those do not share any API endpoints.

a much better solution would be to make starwindow a primary window API, with
starpopup delegated to only managing popup windows screenspace. the structure
is already there but it still needs some work to make it more clear.

more noteably there is a plan to add interactive elements to buffers, so that
a page (a text buffer with lua driver) can be displayed as regular tab
and in a window.
