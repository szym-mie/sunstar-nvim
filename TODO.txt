# General

[1] more config options in lua modules ('setup' functions with more options,
    and sometimes any options :P).
    Other options: amount of tab spaces, disable relative line numbers,
        
[2] export more common config options to the 'starconfig' instead of 
    'init.lua', most options should be accesible by keystreaks.

[3] auto-save after typing, like in intelliJ editors.

# starvcs

[1] add 'git log' coloring via builtin highlighting (later, after the module
    gets basic functionality)

[2] make the module stable - right now it is quite unstable and in a more of
    a debug state than anything

# starkeys

[1] right now when the keystreak is incomplete, a window will appear, but the
    buffer is cleared and you have to retype the keystreak, add a loop keeping
    current selection and 'ESC' key clear keystreak to clear the current input.

# starplugin

[1] it seems the automatic update is broken for some reason, does not run
    on startup unless your local repos are clear/reverted. [DONE]

# starfinder

[1] a project finder tool, remembers last projects and any opened file
    outside of them. [MAJOR REDESIGN]

# starproject

[1] create a project which remembers opened workspace (just opened files for 
    now), define commandline project tasks (build, clean, etc)

[2] screen to select last used projects

[3] ability to open project diectory as a project (if you cannot find it in 
    recents)
